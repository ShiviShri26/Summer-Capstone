# Summary of business problem and project objective.

Many people, especially those without a credit history, can be taken advantage of by unreliable lenders. Home Credit aims to help by making borrowing safe and positive for those who don't use banks. The project's goal is to decrease loan rejections for people who can actually pay back their loans on time. They'll use a special number to predict if a customer will repay the loan. This project uses a dataset to find out which factors are important and to create the best prediction model. This notebook is all about picking the best model from different options to solve HomeCredit's business problem.

# My group's solution to the business problem.

As part of our solution, we've created a classification model to predict if a client might not make their payments. The given data set shows around 91.93% of clients are likely to repay on time, while 8.07% might struggle. Our main focus is on this smaller group â€“ those at risk of not repaying. By understanding their behaviors, we can take proactive steps.

This model reveals insights into what sets these two groups apart. It guides us in smarter loan approvals, making our lending process more secure and sustainable. This approach strengthens our commitment to responsible finance, enhancing our organization's stability and success.

# My contribution to the project

In my contribution to the project, I played a pivotal role in conducting a thorough analysis. I began by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), meticulously examining missing data, handling categorical and numerical values, and creating insightful graphs to visually represent patterns. I then delved into feature engineering, crafting valuable attributes to enhance model performance. Employing both a Random Forest model and a LightGBM model where LightGBM gave the best accuracy, I rigorously evaluated their predictive capabilities where LightGBM gave the best accuracy. The culmination of my efforts is presented in a comprehensive summary table that highlights key findings and showcases the results achieved. My dedicated work across these stages significantly contributed to the project's success, providing actionable insights and fostering a deeper understanding of the data.

# The business value of the solution.

The solution delivers substantial business value by achieving multiple objectives. It significantly reduces defaults, thereby minimizing potential losses and enhancing overall risk management. This translates to a more balanced loan portfolio, ensuring a healthier financial landscape. Additionally, the solution drives increased interest income through a higher frequency of on-time repayments, further strengthening the organization's financial stability and growth trajectory.

# Difficulties that my group encountered along the way.

During our analysis of the Home Credit Default project, we faced several challenges. At the start of our data exploration, we encountered a massive amount of data, which made handling missing values quite tricky. Our initial model's accuracy was disappointing, prompting us to go back and address both the missing values and certain columns to improve accuracy and refine our approach. Moreover, we also grappled with selecting the right features for the model, ensuring that they truly contributed to meaningful predictions. Another obstacle was finding the right balance between model complexity and overfitting, as an overly complex model could lead to inaccurate results. Lastly, interpreting the model's predictions in a way that's understandable and actionable for decision-makers presented its own set of challenges.

# What I learned from the project.

Through this project, I gained invaluable insights into the intricacies of predictive analytics and its real-world applications. I deepened my understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, learning to navigate challenges such as handling missing values effectively. Collaborating with the team enhanced my communication and teamwork skills, while also reinforcing the importance of iteration and continuous improvement in model development. Overall, this project enriched my proficiency in translating complex data into meaningful business solutions.
